# Lt. Toolkit

Lt. Toolkit is an assortment of local-first privacy oriented tools that are built for my streams. Some tools are built for stream ideas, and others are built with everybody in mind.

Under the hood, it uses Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind.

## Getting Started

With your package manager of choice, install the required dependencies:

```bash
bun install
# (e.g npm install, pnpm install, etc...)
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
# (e.g npm run dev, pnpm dev, etc...)
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser, and you should see everything up and running.
